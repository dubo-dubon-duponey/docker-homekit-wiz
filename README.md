## Notes

### Networking

You need to run this in `host` or `mac(or ip)vlan` networking (because of mDNS).

###Â Additional arguments

Any additional arguments when running the image will get fed to the `wizhard` binary.

Try `--help` for more.

### Custom configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables, specifically:

```dockerfile
ENV           HOMEKIT_NAME="Wiz Bing"
ENV           HOMEKIT_PIN="87654312"
ENV           HOMEKIT_MANUFACTURER="DuboDubonDuponey"
ENV           HOMEKIT_SERIAL=""
ENV           HOMEKIT_MODEL="Acme"
ENV           HOMEKIT_VERSION="0"
```
